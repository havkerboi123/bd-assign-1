            "Walaikum asalam,\n\nNust kay liye koi restrictions nhi admission kay liye bss NET clear krna hota hai probably 150+ could get you inn easily. Fast ka bhi same hai fast entry test clear krna hota hai ya phir NTS laikin NTS ki seats kam hoti hain tou i would suggest going for fast's test. Giki different hai uskay liye inter main math honi hi chahiye warna wo mngt scns kay allawa koi alag department offer hi nhi krtay \n\nI reckon tumhara interest giki main hai tou try karo additional math ka ppr dedon 2026 board pprs main ( i did alevels so i dont really know about punjab board kay wo bio aur math dono kay ppr kay liye ek saath appear krnay detay hain ya nhi) \n\nYe universities annually ek hi intake leti hain august/ sep main classes bhi start ho jaati hain\n\nAur koi questions hon to feel free to dm."
